    <long_description>Tilt the floor to roll a ball through an obstacle course within the given time. If the ball falls or time expires, a ball is lost.

Collect coins to unlock the exit and earn extra balls. Red coins are worth 5. Blue coins are worth 10. A ball is awarded for 100 coins.

This is an incomplete port of Neverball to the Wii. The framerate sucks and many graphical features are not implemented yet. I hope to improve this in the future.</long_description>
